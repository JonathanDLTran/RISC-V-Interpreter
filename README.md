# RISC-V-Interpreter
Interpreter for a core subset of the RISC-V language, written in OCaml. The ultimate goal is to have a front end that can parse a text file into an expression list, which is then executed via evaluation. 

Inspired by an assignment for Fall CS 3410, Cornell University. However, this my work differs in substantial ways from that assignment.
