# RISC-V-Interpreter
Interpreter for a core subset of the RISC-V language, written in OCaml. The ultimate goal is to have a front end that can parse a text file into an expression list, which is then executed via evaluation. 

Inspired by an assignment for Fall CS 3410, Cornell University. However, this my work differs in substantial ways from that assignment.

The real goal of this project is expand what I have done previously. In the last few weeks, I have built a full RISC-V processor in Logisim, that supports the exact same subset of the RISC-V language. My focus at the lower level of hardward has allowed me to build the model of the processor and write assembly scripts to run games like Pong on the processor. I felt it would be interesting to try somnething higher level on the software side, which is why I built this interpreter. 

Another reason for this project is to keep my OCaml and functional programming skills at a high level, because recently, I have only been programming in RISCV assembly and C. Also, I had an extended vacation due to the Coronavirus outbreak, and I have found doing projects, especially related to computer science, a good use of my time.
